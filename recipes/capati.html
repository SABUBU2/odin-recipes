  <h2>ingredients</h2>

  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li></li>

     <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour plus a little more flour for kneading</li>
       <li> 1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
        
       <li> 1¼ Cups Water</li>
      
    
  
  </ul>
  <h3>STEPS</h3>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>step1:<br><br>
        In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and oil in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the water a little at a time to form a soft and sticky dough.</li>
          <li>step2:<br><br>
            Turn to a floured surface; knead for about 10 to 15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place in a bowl. Cover and let it rest in a warm place for about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
         <li>step3:<br><br>
            Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide the dough into 8 equal parts and roll each piece into a circle. You can roll out the dough into a circle cook the Chapatis at this point. However, if you want a flaky and well-layered chapati, move on with the rest of the steps below.</li>
             <li>step4:<br><br>
                Lightly brush the rolled out chapati with some Oil and roll it as you would roll up a mat. At this point, it should be like a rope then roll the ”rope-like” to form a coil then pull the tip towards the center of the coil and tuck in using your index finger then cover it up with a damp towel and leave it to rest for about 10 to 15 minutes. (Please refer to image above)     
            </li>
            <li>step5:<br><br>
                <li>Flour your work surface again and start rolling out each of the coiled dough to about 1/8th thickness (the dough will eventually shrink up to about 1-2/4 inch thickness).</li>
            <li>step6:<br><br>
                <li>Preheat a non-stick pan or a heavy bottom skillet. Place the chapati on inside the pan and leave it to cook for a few seconds before disturbing it. </li>
            <li>step7:<br><br>
                <li>Brush the surface of the chapati with a very thin layer of oil. Once you begin to see bubbles rise on top of the chapati, flip it over to the other side and brush it also with a thin layer of Oil.</li>
                <li>step8:<br><br>
                    <li>Continue to flip over about one or two more times until you achieve your desired brownness. Serve hot or warm and enjoy with your favorite dish.</li>
            </ul>
